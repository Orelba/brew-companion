# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** October 3, 2025

Welcome to BrewCompanion (“BrewCompanion”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website and services at brewcompanion.app and any related applications, features or functionality (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Who we are & contact

BrewCompanion is provided under the name BrewCompanion and operated by the developer of the app.  
Contact: support@brewcompanion.app

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age for digital consent in your country) to use the Services. If local law requires a higher age for digital consent where you live (for example, some EU member states use 16), you must meet that age requirement before creating an account. By creating an account you represent that you meet the applicable age requirement.

## 3. Accounts

Some features require an account. You may register using an email and password or through third-party sign-in methods if offered. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately at support@brewcompanion.app if you suspect unauthorized use.

## 4. User content and license

You retain ownership of the content you upload or submit (for example: brew logs, tasting notes, photos, roastery information, comments). By uploading content you grant BrewCompanion a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license to host, store, transmit, display, reproduce, modify, and otherwise use that content for the purpose of operating and providing the Services, including backups, search, feeds, social features, and analytics. This license terminates when you delete your content, except to the extent copies remain in backups or where we are required or permitted to retain data by law. We may aggregate and anonymize user content for analytics and product improvement; aggregated data does not identify you individually.

## 5. Privacy

Your use of the Services is governed by our Privacy Policy, available at brewcompanion.app/privacy. The Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, and how to exercise your rights.

## 6. Visibility and sharing

By default, user content is private. If we introduce sharing, commenting, reviews, or public articles, those features will require an explicit action from you to make content visible to others. We will provide clear controls and settings for sharing.

## 7. Donations and payments

BrewCompanion currently does not offer paid subscription plans. Donations are accepted via third-party platforms such as Buy Me a Coffee. Donations are processed by the third-party platform and are subject to that platform’s terms and privacy policy. If we introduce paid services in the future, we will publish payment and refund terms.

## 8. Acceptable use

You must not use the Services to:

- Violate any applicable law or the rights of others;
- Upload content that is unlawful, abusive, infringing, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
- Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our systems or breach security;
- Interfere with other users’ access to or use of the Services.

We may remove content or restrict access for violations of these Terms.

## 9. Moderation and takedown

We may monitor, remove, or disable access to content that violates these Terms or that we reasonably suspect is unlawful or harmful. We may suspend or terminate accounts for conduct that violates these Terms.

## 10. Disclaimers

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, BrewCompanion disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.

## 11. Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BrewCompanion’s total liability to you for any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you paid to BrewCompanion in the 12 months preceding the claim; or (b) USD 50. In jurisdictions where such a limitation is not permitted, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. BrewCompanion is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold BrewCompanion and its officers, agents, and employees harmless from any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services, your content, or your breach of these Terms.

## 13. Termination

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your account or access to the Services at any time for violation of these Terms or for any lawful reason. You may delete your account through the account settings or by contacting support@brewcompanion.app. Deletion of your account does not necessarily remove all content immediately from backup systems.

## 14. Changes to the Terms

We may modify these Terms. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms at brewcompanion.app and provide notice where appropriate. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 15. Governing law and dispute resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Israel without regard to conflict-of-law rules. To the extent permitted by law, disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of Israel.

## 16. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and BrewCompanion regarding the Services.
