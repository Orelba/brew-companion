# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 3, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how BrewCompanion collects, uses, discloses, stores, and protects personal data when you use brewcompanion.app and related Services. It also explains your rights and how to exercise them, including under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other international privacy laws.

## 1. Data controller and contact

Controller: BrewCompanion (operated by the developer of the app)  
Contact: support@brewcompanion.app

## 2. Data we collect

We collect the following categories of personal data:

- **Account and profile information:** email address, username, hashed password, profile picture, profile preferences.
- **User content:** brew logs, tasting notes, roastery details, photos, comments, and any other content you upload.
- **Technical and usage data:** device identifiers, IP address, browser and operating system, log files, crash reports, usage metrics, timestamps.
- **Communications:** messages and emails between you and our support team.
- **Payment/donation metadata:** donation amounts and transaction IDs when you donate via third parties; payment card data is handled by the third-party processor and is not stored by us.

## 3. Legal bases for processing (where applicable)

Where applicable under laws such as the GDPR, our legal bases for processing personal data are:

- **Performance of a contract:** necessary to provide the Services and manage your account.
- **Consent:** where you give consent for optional processing (for example, newsletters or analytics where required).
- **Legitimate interests:** to operate, secure, and improve the Services, prevent fraud, and carry out analytics, balanced against your rights.
- **Legal obligation:** to comply with legal requirements.

## 4. How we use personal data

We use personal data to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Services.
- Authenticate and manage your account.
- Respond to support and security incidents.
- Detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, or illegal activity.
- Conduct analytics and product research using aggregated or pseudonymized data.
- Fulfill legal obligations.

## 5. Data sharing and third-party processors

We do not sell personal data. We share personal data with:

- Service providers and subprocessors who perform services on our behalf, including data hosting and database services (for example, MongoDB Atlas), email providers, and analytics or crash-reporting providers if enabled.
- Legal authorities when required by law or to protect rights and safety.
- Aggregated or anonymized datasets that no longer identify individuals.

We enter into contracts with processors that require appropriate technical and organizational measures and restrict use of personal data to our instructions.

## 6. International data transfers

Personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your jurisdiction, including the United States and other countries that may have different data protection laws. Where transfers occur from the European Economic Area (EEA) or other jurisdictions with data transfer rules, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

## 7. Cookies and tracking technologies

We may use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, preferences, security, and optional analytics. If we enable analytics or advertising products that require consent by law, we will request consent where required and provide opt-out mechanisms.

## 8. Analytics and optional tracking

We currently do not have third-party analytics enabled. If analytics are enabled, we will disclose the provider and give users the option to opt out. We recommend privacy-preserving analytics solutions to minimize data collection.

## 9. Data retention

We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When you delete your account we will delete personal data within a reasonable period except where we are required to retain data for legal reasons or for backups.

## 10. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. Examples include encrypted connections (HTTPS), access controls, and secure hosting. No system is perfectly secure; in the event of a data breach we will comply with applicable notification laws.

## 11. Your privacy rights

Where applicable (for example under the GDPR), you have rights in relation to your personal data, including:

- **Right of access:** request copies of your personal data.
- **Right to rectification:** correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Right to erasure:** request deletion of personal data where permitted by law.
- **Right to restriction of processing:** request limits on how we use your data.
